// 1. Create a type BibliographyItem that has the following structure:
// string list * string * (int * int) * int
// The meaning of the tuple elements is as follows:
// * The first field represents the list of author names where each name is in the format
//   "Lastname, Firstname1 Firstname2" (i.e. listing all first names after comma)
// * The second field represents the title of the publication
// * The third field represents a pair containing the starting page number and ending page number of the paper.
// * The fourth field represents the year of publication

type BibliographyItem = string list * string * (int * int) * int

// 2. Create a value bibliographyData : BibliographyItem list that contains
// at least 7 different publications on your favourite topic from https://dblp.uni-trier.de/ 
// Please note that you need not read the papers, just pick 7 papers that sound interesting to you from the database.
